## Introduction
Hi, my name is Danielle! I am a software engineer/architect, educator, and improvisational musician with expertise in systems-level programming, cloud architecture, backend web development, and platform automation. As a programmer, I am proficient in C/C++, C#/.NET, Python, JavaScript, SQL/NoSQL databases, and shell scripting in Bash/ZSH and Powershell. Rust is the main language I am learning now (via the Rust Book, not Generative AI).
